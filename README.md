# conceptGraph

Conceptual Graphs inspired by John F Sowa.

Create Concept Graphs and Schemas, that can call functions and access databases
to create answer graphs.

Best enjoyed with some white papers along side.

Theory comes straight from John F. Sowa's Paper titled
 "Conceptual Graphs for a Data Base Interface" - July 1976
 All credit for the Theory of Conceptual Graphs goes to Sowa amongst many
 other great minds before him, who believe in a better, more human-like
 computer interaction. We truly stand on the shoulders of giants.
